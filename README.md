# ATSAMS70, ATSAME70, ATSAMV70, ATSAMV71 support for Rust

This repository holds various things that support/enable working with Microchip (formerly Atmel) SAMS70 family based
devices in Rust. Known boards using some of these chips:

* [ATSAME70-XPLD](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAME70-XPLD)
* [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)
* [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMV71-XULT)
* [Tsunami Super WAV Trigger](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13810)

## Status

This repository holds work in very early stage of development and doesn't provide any working support at the board level. Major pressure is put on support of [ATSAMS70Q21](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMS70Q21).
